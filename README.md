# Practicing Active Directory

## Objective


My goal is to build a personal cybersecurity homelab that simulates real-world environments to practice virtualization.This lab will give me the opportunity to strengthen my hands-on skills with industry tools and technologies while expanding my technical knowledge. By documenting my progress and projects, I can showcase my problem-solving abilities and technical expertise to potential employers. In this case, I will be trying to generate telemetry within the Windows 10 VM to review with Splunk and Sysmon; simulating incident detection.
